# Introduction to Machine Learning

Short interactive course to introduce basics of Machine Learning.

## Expected features: 
- [ ] Explain the basics of Machine Learning (e.g. gradient descent).
    - [ ] What is Machine Learning? Explain main concepts (e.g. gradient descent, overfitting)
    - [ ] Where to use Machine Learning? Present Machine Learning frameworks (Tensorflow vs. Torch)
    - [ ] When to use Machine Learning? Conditions to use Machine Learning (e.g large dataset)
    - [ ] Who is using Machine Learning? Give examples of uses of Machine Learning in different fields
    - [ ] Why to use Machine Learning? 
    - [ ] How to use Machine Learning? see `.Rmd` file
- [ ] Provide an interactive notebook to create and train simple neural network.
- [ ] Give references to go further.

Work in progres....
